# What is DeltaFi?

DeltaFi is a high-performance DEX that provides DeFi users with the fairest pool prices, sustainable yields for liquidity providers, and cross-chain compatibility to let you trade assets quickly.

Existing AMMs rely on the constant product formula, which while innovative at its inception, is in need of improvement. We have designed our protocol to solve for the pain points that arise when using the constant product formula â€“ like token price slippage upon the execution of a trade, and inefficient liquidity pool pricing that can lead to a loss of funds for a liquidity provider.

Our mission is to provide DeFi users with the most efficient, user-friendly, and enjoyable experience possible. We have ambitious goals, and we are so excited to share what we have built for you.
