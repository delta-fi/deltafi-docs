Determining whether a pool is offering a fair price is a common issue encountered by DeFi users. They may compare pool prices between exchanges - a time-consuming process. Or, they trust that the price offered by the exchange is the current market rate. At DeltaFi, weâ€™ve solved this problem by adopting a real-time, on-chain oracle that aggregates market data from multiple sources, ensuring that users get the most up-to-date prices for their swaps and trades.
