# DeltaFi's Competitive Advantages

{% hint style="info" %}
**Fair Prices, Sustainable Liquidity Yields, and Native to Native Swap**
{% endhint %}

* Fair Prices – Determining whether a pool is offering a fair price is a common issue encountered by DeFi users. They may compare pool prices between exchanges - a time-consuming process. Or, they trust that the price offered by the exchange is the current market rate. At DeltaFi, we’ve solved this problem by adopting a real-time, on-chain oracle that aggregates market data from multiple sources, ensuring that users get the most up-to-date prices for their swaps and trades.&#x20;
* Sustainable Yields – Liquidity providers can generate sizeable and consistent returns on DeltaFi. You can do this via yield farming – supplying liquidity to a protocol to then earn interest “yield,” on the assets deposited. Our protocol design mitigates liquidity loss by utilizing accurate market data, ensuring that you earn the best rates available. &#x20;
* Cross Chain Swap – We have integrated with Wormhole, a cross-chain bridge that connects Solana with other DeFi networks. The multi-chain interoperability lets users quickly swap assets between other mainstream chains like Ethereum, BSC, etc. &#x20;
