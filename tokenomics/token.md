# DELFI Tokens



The DELFI token is a governance token with time-weighted voting and value accrual mechanisms. As a DELFI holder, you can:&#x20;

* Facilitate on-chain governance - DELFI holders could use their tokens to participate in the governance of the project including proposing referenda, electing council members, and voting.&#x20;
* Use DELFI to pay for gas fees - When users trade on decentralized exchanges, there are gas fees that come along with smart contract execution. DELFI tokens can be used to pay these fees. &#x20;
* Accrue value for network participants - DELFI holders can stake their assets for vDELFI, and earn a profit from fees collected in the pool. The longer the staking period is, the higher the reward rate will be. &#x20;

Hereâ€™s how the DELFI utility token works at a high-level:&#x20;

1. LP tokens can be used to farm DELFI tokens at a reward rate governed by a vote vault.  &#x20;
2. LP token holders are also rewarded with fees collected in the pool. &#x20;
3. DELFI token can be staked for vDELFI. The longer the staking period is, the higher the reward rate will be. &#x20;
4. vDELFI tokens have governance rights for proposal approvals and vote for proposals such as yield farming rate changes for particular pools, future development proposals and so on. &#x20;
5. Protocol treasury accumulates from fee collection and on-chain arbitrages with external exchanges such as Serum and Raydium. Future protocols may accrue revenues as well which will be directed to the treasury.&#x20;
6. A portion of the protocol treasury will be channeled to vDELFI token holders via DELFI token buybacks and pool deposits. This incentivizes the long-term staking value of the DELFI token.&#x20;
